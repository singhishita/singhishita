## Hello there!ðŸ‘‹ 
### I'm glad to *e-meet* you!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Support Engineering Intern at Microsoft.
- ðŸŒ± I leverage programming to harness the power of technology and develop efficient customer solutions.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to collaborate on addressing technically complex problems identified in Microsoft products.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to chase your passion alongside a full-time professional degree/job and become financially independent ;)
- âš¡ Fun fact about me: I wanted to pursue 3 undergraduate degrees. Spilled the beans already! ;)
